# Session Summary Fix for Anonymous Users

## Problem Description

Anonymous users were experiencing an incorrect session summary when clicking the "Finish" button. The summary screen would display incorrect values for:

1. **Total Questions Answered** - Was only showing the current session's questions instead of all accumulated questions since the user started playing
2. **First Time Correct** - Was only showing the current session's first-time correct count
3. **Base Points** - Was calculating points based only on the current session's stats

For example, an anonymous user might see:
```
Session Complete!
Session Summary
Questions Answered: 20
First Time Correct: 5 × 3 = 15 pts
Eventually Correct: 0 × 1 = 0 pts
Base Points: 15
```

Even though they had actually completed multiple sessions with many more questions.

## Root Cause

The issue was that the `handleEndSession` function in `MinimalDistinctionPlayer.tsx` was only using the current session's stats when preparing the session summary, instead of including the accumulated statistics from all sessions since the user started playing.

For anonymous users, we need to maintain cumulative statistics across multiple sessions as they play through the app, before eventually clicking "Finish" or creating an account.

## Fix Implementation

We've updated the session summary calculation in `MinimalDistinctionPlayer.tsx` to:

1. Get current session statistics:
```javascript
const correctResults = sessionResults.filter(r => r.correct);
const currentSessionCorrectAnswers = correctResults.length;
const currentSessionFirstTimeCorrect = sessionResults.filter(r => r.firstTimeCorrect).length;

// Calculate the total questions completed in the current session
const currentSessionQuestions = Math.max(
  new Set(sessionResults.map(r => r.id)).size,
  sessionQuestions.length
);
```

2. For anonymous users, add previously accumulated statistics from localStorage:
```javascript
// Initialize with current session values
let totalQuestions = currentSessionQuestions;
let correctAnswers = currentSessionCorrectAnswers;
let firstTimeCorrect = currentSessionFirstTimeCorrect;

// If anonymous, get accumulated data from localStorage
if (isAnonymous && typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  try {
    // Check if we have accumulated data in localStorage
    const savedState = localStorage.getItem('zenjin_anonymous_state');
    if (savedState) {
      const parsedState = JSON.parse(savedState);
      // Add previously accumulated stats to current session stats
      if (parsedState.state && parsedState.state.accumulatedSessionData) {
        const accData = parsedState.state.accumulatedSessionData;
        totalQuestions += (accData.totalQuestions || 0);
        correctAnswers += (accData.correctAnswers || 0);
        firstTimeCorrect += (accData.firstTimeCorrect || 0);
      }
      console.log(`Anonymous user accumulated stats: 
        Total questions: ${totalQuestions}
        Correct answers: ${correctAnswers}
        First time correct: ${firstTimeCorrect}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading accumulated data from localStorage:', error);
    // Fall back to current session values
    totalQuestions = currentSessionQuestions;
    correctAnswers = currentSessionCorrectAnswers;
    firstTimeCorrect = currentSessionFirstTimeCorrect;
  }
}
```

3. Calculate the base points using these accumulated values:
```javascript
// Calculate base points using our formula with the accumulated values
// This will include all points earned since the user started playing
const basePoints = calculateBasePoints(firstTimeCorrect, eventuallyCorrect);
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Feedback**: Anonymous users now see an accurate summary of their total learning progress when they click "Finish"
2. **Consistent Experience**: The session summary now matches the points displayed during gameplay
3. **Better Engagement**: Seeing their true accumulated progress encourages users to continue playing or create an account

## Verification

To verify this fix:
1. Play through multiple sessions as an anonymous user
2. Click "Finish" at any point
3. Verify that the session summary shows:
   - The total number of questions answered across all sessions
   - The total first-time correct count across all sessions
   - The total eventually correct count across all sessions
   - The correct base points calculated from these accumulated totals

## Technical Note

This fix works by leveraging the existing `accumulatedSessionData` structure that's stored in localStorage for anonymous users, which tracks ongoing progress across multiple sessions. We're now incorporating that data into the session summary, providing a more accurate representation of the user's overall learning journey.
