# Session Summary Fix for Anonymous Users

## Problem Description

Anonymous users were experiencing an incorrect session summary when clicking the "Finish" button:

1. **Incorrect Questions Count** - The questions count was being forced to match stitch length (typically 20), even when sessions ended mid-stitch.

For example, an anonymous user might see:
```
Session Complete!
Session Summary
Questions Answered: 20  (incorrect - should show actual questions answered, e.g., 7)
First Time Correct: 5 × 3 = 15 pts
Eventually Correct: 0 × 1 = 0 pts
Base Points: 15
```

Even when they had only answered 7 questions before clicking "Finish".

## Root Causes

1. **Forced Question Count**: The code was always assuming complete stitches (20 questions each), ignoring that:
   - Sessions can end mid-stitch (user clicking "Finish" before completing all 20 questions)
   - The actual number of questions answered is the relevant metric, not the stitch size

2. **Anonymous State Clearing**: Anonymous user state was being incorrectly cleared from localStorage at the end of sessions, preventing proper progress tracking.

## Fix Implementation

We've made multiple changes to address these issues:

### 1. Count Actual Questions Answered

```javascript
// Calculate the number of questions actually answered in the current session
// This will count the number of unique question IDs in the sessionResults
// A session can end mid-stitch, so we can't assume all questions in a stitch were answered
const currentSessionQuestions = new Set(sessionResults.map(r => r.id)).size;
```

### 2. Properly Save Anonymous User State

We modified the localStorage handling to ensure anonymous user state persists between sessions:

```javascript
// For authenticated users only, clear localStorage to ensure next session starts fresh from server
// For anonymous users, we MUST preserve their state in localStorage
debug('Step 3: Clearing localStorage cache for authenticated user to ensure fresh state next session');
try {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    // Clear only the authenticated user state from localStorage
    // Keep the anonymous state intact as it's needed for continuity
    localStorage.removeItem(`triple_helix_state_${userId}`);
    
    // Do NOT remove zenjin_anonymous_state for authenticated users either
    // as they might switch back to anonymous mode in another window/session
    // localStorage.removeItem('zenjin_anonymous_state');
    
    debug('Successfully cleared authenticated user state cache');
  }
} catch (clearError) {
  debug(`Non-critical error clearing localStorage: ${clearError}`);
}
```

### 3. Use Only Current Session Stats for Summary

```javascript
// For the session summary, we only need the current session's stats
// We don't add accumulated stats from previous sessions here
// This is because the session summary shows only the current session,
// while accumulated stats are used for overall progress tracking

// Use current session values only - don't add accumulated data
totalQuestions = currentSessionQuestions;
correctAnswers = currentSessionCorrectAnswers;
firstTimeCorrect = currentSessionFirstTimeCorrect;
```

### 4. Count Actual Questions in handleSessionComplete

```javascript
// Use actual number of questions answered from the results
if (results.results) {
  const uniqueQuestionIds = new Set(results.results.map(r => r.id));
  const actualQuestionCount = uniqueQuestionIds.size;
  
  debug(`Actual questions answered in this session: ${actualQuestionCount}`);
  results.totalQuestions = actualQuestionCount;
}
```

### 5. Remove Forced Question Count Overrides

We've removed checks that would override the actual question count with the stitch length:

```javascript
// We no longer force total questions to match the stitch length
// A session can end mid-stitch, so we count the actual number of questions answered
```

## Important Clarifications

1. **Session Boundaries**:
   - A session begins when a user starts learning (or clicks "Continue Learning")
   - A session ends when a user clicks "Finish"
   - Each "Finish" marks the end of a discrete session

2. **Session Summary Scope**:
   - The session summary shows ONLY the current session's results
   - It does not show accumulated stats across all sessions

3. **Progress Persistence**:
   - Anonymous users: Progress is saved in localStorage and must persist between sessions
   - Authenticated users: Progress is saved to the server, localStorage can be cleared

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Question Count**: The session summary now shows the actual number of questions answered in the current session
2. **Persistent Anonymous Progress**: Anonymous users' progress is now properly preserved between sessions
3. **Realistic Feedback**: The summary accurately reflects what users did in their current session
4. **In-Progress Sessions**: Users who click "Finish" mid-stitch get an accurate count of questions they've answered

## Verification

To verify this fix:
1. Begin a session as an anonymous user
2. Answer only a few questions (less than 20)
3. Click "Finish"
4. Verify that the session summary shows:
   - Only the actual number of questions answered in this session
   - The correct first-time/eventually correct counts for this session only
   - The correct base points for this session only

## Technical Details

This fix leverages:
1. Set operations to count unique question IDs for accurate question count
2. Careful localStorage management to ensure anonymous progress persists
3. Using session-specific values for the summary, not accumulated totals
4. Proper error handling and detailed logging for troubleshooting
