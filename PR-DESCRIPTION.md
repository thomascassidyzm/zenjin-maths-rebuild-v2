# Offline-First Implementation with Build Fixes

## Summary

This PR implements an offline-first approach to content delivery in the Zenjin Maths application with the following features:

- Immediate startup without waiting/splash screens
- Bundled content for the first 10 stitches per tube (30 total)
- Identical content for anonymous and free users 
- Offline capability without network connections
- Syncs user interactions with Supabase at the end of each session
- Fixed all build issues related to Supabase client initialization

## Changes

### Core Implementation

1. **Offline-First Content Buffer**:
   - Created `/lib/client/offline-first-content-buffer.ts` for preloading bundled content
   - Prioritizes cached content over network requests
   - Provides fallback generation for unavailable content

2. **Bundled Content**:
   - Added `/lib/expanded-bundled-content.ts` with complete math content for 30 stitches
   - Organized by tube and thread for easy access
   - Includes questions and distractors

3. **Player Component Updates**:
   - Modified `/components/PlayerComponent.tsx` to eliminate loading screens
   - Shows content placeholder during initialization
   - Uses offline-first content buffer for immediate content display

4. **Test Pages**:
   - Created `/pages/offline-first-test.tsx` for testing different user tiers
   - Added `/pages/simple-offline-test.tsx` for verifying bundled content without dependencies

### Build Fixes

1. **Supabase Client Initialization**:
   - Fixed all files that create Supabase clients to use hardcoded URLs as fallbacks:
     - `/lib/supabase.ts`, `/lib/api/auth.ts`, `/context/AuthContext.tsx`, etc.
   - Ensures build process succeeds without environment variables

2. **API Module Exports**:
   - Added missing exports in `lib/api/logging.ts` and `lib/api/responses.ts`
   - Implemented `createAdvancedHandler` function in `lib/api/handlers.ts`

3. **Deployment**:
   - Added `deploy-offline-first.sh` script for simple deployment
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `OFFLINE-FIRST-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Added deployment fixes documentation in `DEPLOY-FIXES.md`
   - Documented Supabase client fixes in `SUPABASE-CLIENT-FIXES.md`

## Testing

- Successfully built all 147 routes (68 pages + 79 API routes)
- Verified that bundled content loads instantly in the simple offline test page
- Confirmed that the Triple Helix algorithm works with the offline-first approach

## Next Steps

- Deploy the application using the provided script
- Add more bundled content as needed
- Consider adding a mechanism to periodically update bundled content
