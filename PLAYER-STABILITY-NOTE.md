# Zenjin Maths Player Stability Note

## Current Build Status

This build represents a reversion to a known stable version of the Zenjin Maths player (commit `984993cce6525312079278f1885f9798db12f261`). This decision was made to restore full player functionality after encountering integration issues with newer features.

## Key Information

- **Deployment Date**: May 3, 2025
- **Base Commit**: `984993cce6525312079278f1885f9798db12f261`
- **Restored Functionality**: Triple Helix learning player and all related components

## What Was Reverted

Recent development work focused on implementing subscription features using React Context API. While the implementation was technically sound, it introduced subtle integration issues with the core player functionality. Rather than attempt incremental fixes that might further destabilize the player, we've reverted to the last known stable build.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy this stable version to restore full player functionality for all users
2. **Short-term**: Re-implement subscription features with a completely isolated architecture
3. **Mid-term**: Develop comprehensive integration tests for the player to prevent future regressions

## Future Subscription Implementation Plan

The subscription system will be re-implemented with these principles:

1. **Complete Isolation**: Use feature flags to fully isolate subscription code from player code
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add subscription features as opt-in enhancements, not core requirements
3. **Extensive Testing**: Add dedicated test cases for player functionality with subscription features enabled
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all functionality works even when subscription features are disabled

## Technical Details

The core player relies on specific state management patterns that were inadvertently affected by the subscription context integration. The primary issues were:

1. Provider nesting affecting component rendering cycles
2. Context hydration timing conflicts with the player's initialization
3. State update conflicts between different context providers

By reverting to the stable version, we ensure that all users have a reliable experience while we implement a more robust solution.

## For Developers

If you're working on this codebase:

1. Be extremely cautious about modifying any files in `/lib/triple-helix/` and `/components/TubeCycler.tsx`
2. Any context providers should be conditionally rendered based on feature flags
3. Player functionality must be tested thoroughly after any changes to global state or context
4. Always verify the minimal-player and triple-helix pages before deploying
