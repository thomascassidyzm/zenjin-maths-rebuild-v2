# Warm-Up Mode Fixes Summary

## 1. Data Field Normalization (Critical)

We enhanced field normalization to handle both camelCase and snake_case field formats consistently:

- Improved `normalizeQuestionFormat` in `lib/warmUpQuestions.ts` to handle a wider variety of field name formats
- Added more robust handling for `correctAnswer` vs `correct_answer` fields
- Added support for lowercase distractor fields (l1, l2, l3) in addition to uppercase (L1, L2, L3)
- Added logging to help debug field normalization issues
- Ensured normalization is applied at all critical points in the question loading process

## 2. Button Positioning (Critical)

Fixed the answer button positioning issues in the player:

- Adjusted button container width to ensure buttons stay within the visible area
- Reduced individual button width to prevent buttons from extending beyond boundaries
- Optimized absolute positioning to ensure consistent placement even on narrow screens
- Fixed footer height to prevent it from expanding and shifting content on narrow screens

## 3. Tube Cycling

Implemented tube cycling in warm-up mode:

- Enhanced `moveToNextQuestion` in `MinimalDistinctionPlayer` to handle tube cycling when a stitch is completed
- Added tube cycling detection and handling in the player
- Added state to track current tube in `WarmUpMode`
- Ensured proper communication between player and warm-up mode components when cycling tubes
- Added validation to ensure next tube has questions before attempting to cycle

## 4. Transition Animation Improvements

Simplified and optimized the transition animation:

- Reduced overall animation duration from 2.5s to 2s for a faster experience
- Adjusted timing of fades to show the player earlier (80 degrees vs 90 degrees)
- Enhanced appearance of real player on card back
- Made animation timing more responsive to prevent delays

## Testing Guidelines

The fixes should be tested in the following scenarios:

1. **Correct Answer Testing**: Verify that the player correctly processes answers regardless of field format
2. **Button Visibility**: Check that both answer buttons are fully visible in various screen widths
3. **Button Positioning**: Ensure buttons don't move unexpectedly during screen resize
4. **Tube Cycling**: Complete all questions in a tube to verify cycling to the next tube works correctly
5. **Transition Speed**: Verify transition animation shows the real player without excessive delay

## Known Limitations

- Some React hydration warnings may still occur during initial render
- Points data persistence between sessions is a separate issue outside this fix scope
- Answer button positioning is optimized for the 375px width player display

These fixes address all the critical issues while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
