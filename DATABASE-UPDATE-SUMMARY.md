# Database Update Summary

## Background

The Zenjin Maths application was experiencing issues with progress data not being saved correctly to the database. User points, sessions, and progress were not appearing in the dashboard consistently. The problem was related to the way UUID and text data types were being handled in the database, particularly for anonymous users.

## Changes Made

### 1. UUID Handling

The core issue was related to the way user IDs were being handled. The database expected UUID values, but sometimes received text values, leading to type mismatch errors. We've implemented a more robust approach:

- Created a consistent `anonymous_user_id()` function that returns a fixed UUID
- Updated all policies to handle both UUID and string representations
- Added fallback conditions for when the function isn't available

### 2. Enhanced Security Policies

All Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been updated to include better conditions:

```sql
CREATE POLICY example_policy ON table_name
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR 
        user_id = anonymous_user_id() OR 
        user_id::text LIKE 'diag-%' OR
        (user_id::text = 'anonymous' AND anonymous_user_id() IS NULL)
    );
```

This ensures:
- Authenticated users can access their own data
- Anonymous users are properly recognized (both as UUID and as 'anonymous' string)
- Diagnostic IDs for testing work correctly

### 3. Data Transfer Function

The `transfer_anonymous_data` function has been improved to:
- Handle diagnostic IDs properly
- Better handle UUID conversion
- Include proper error handling
- Ensure successful data transfer from anonymous to authenticated users

### 4. Script Compatibility

- Removed superuser commands that might fail on hosted environments
- Ensured compatibility with Supabase's security model
- Created a verification script to test the database setup

## Files Updated

1. **setup-database.sql**
   - Enhanced the anonymous_user_id() function
   - Updated all RLS policies for UUID compatibility
   - Improved the data transfer function

2. **enable-rls.sql**
   - Removed problematic superuser commands
   - Ensured compatibility with hosted environments

3. **DATABASE-SETUP-GUIDE.md**
   - Added information about UUID handling
   - Enhanced troubleshooting section
   - Added new examples for testing

4. **DATABASE-FIX.md** (New)
   - Detailed explanation of the problem and solution
   - Step-by-step instructions for applying the fix
   - Technical details for developers

5. **verify-database.sql** (New)
   - Script to verify the database setup
   - Tests for RLS policies, functions, and data access

6. **API Endpoints Fixed**
   - `pages/api/save-session.ts` - Fixed UUID handling for session saving
   - `pages/api/save-tube-position.ts` - Added UUID conversion for tube position
   - `pages/api/update-progress.ts` - Updated to use consistent UUID format

## Expected Results

After applying these updates:

1. Progress data will be correctly saved to the database
2. Points and sessions will appear in the dashboard
3. The UUID comparison errors will be resolved
4. Anonymous users will be able to save progress
5. Data will transfer correctly when users authenticate

## How to Apply

1. Log in to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the updated `setup-database.sql` script
4. Run the `enable-rls.sql` script
5. Verify with `verify-database.sql`
6. Test the application functionality

## Future Recommendations

1. **Database Monitoring**: Consider adding a database monitoring solution to catch similar issues early
2. **Type Safety**: Enforce consistent handling of UUIDs throughout the application
3. **Migration Scripts**: Create migration scripts for future schema changes
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive database tests to the CI/CD pipeline
