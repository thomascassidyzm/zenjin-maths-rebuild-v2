# Data Persistence Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address issues with data persistence and database interaction in the Zenjin Maths application.

## Problem Overview

Several API endpoints were attempting to use tables that don't exist in the database schema, causing 500 errors when trying to save or retrieve user data:

1. `user_tube_position` table - Referenced but didn't exist
2. `sessions` table - Referenced but didn't exist
3. `user_sessions` table - Referenced as fallback but didn't exist
4. Various column mismatches and schema inconsistencies

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Tube Position Handling

We've completely redesigned how tube positions are stored and retrieved:

- **Storage**: Now uses `user_stitch_progress` table with `is_current_tube` flag
- **Retrieval**: Implements a multi-level retrieval approach with fallbacks
- **Active Stitches**: Properly tracks the active stitch (order_number = 0) in each tube
- **Documentation**: Added detailed documentation in `TUBE-POSITION-FIX.md`

### 2. Session Recording

The `record-session.ts` endpoint has been updated to:

- Check for table existence before attempting operations
- Use `session_results` table instead of non-existent tables
- Add explicit ID generation with `session-{timestamp}-{random}` format
- Add comprehensive fallbacks for different schema variations
- Properly handle profile updates

### 3. End Session Handling

The `end-session.ts` endpoint has been improved to:

- Process and save all tube and stitch updates from local storage
- Record session completion in `session_results` table
- Update user profiles when available
- Handle perfect scores by advancing stitches in the learning queue
- Return session summary data for dashboard display

### 4. Stitch Progress Updates

The stitch progression handling has been fixed to:

- Use `user_stitch_progress` table correctly
- Handle different schema variations
- Use `upsert` with conflict handling for robust updates
- Update order_number based on performance

### 5. User Profile Management

We've improved how user profiles are handled:

- Check for table existence before operations
- Update points, blink speed, and evolution level
- Calculate weighted averages for performance metrics
- Handle schema variations with adaptive field inclusion

## Database Tables Used

Our solution now relies on these confirmed existing tables:

1. `threads` - Stores learning threads with tube_number assignments
2. `stitches` - Stores individual learning units
3. `questions` - Stores questions for each stitch
4. `user_stitch_progress` - Tracks user progress and current tube focus
5. `session_results` - Records session completion data
6. `profiles` - Stores user profile information (when available)

## State Flow

1. **During Gameplay**:
   - All game state is stored in local storage
   - No database writes occur until session completion

2. **On Session End (Finish button)**:
   - Local state is sent to `end-session` API
   - Session results are stored in `session_results`
   - User stitch progress is updated in `user_stitch_progress`
   - User profile is updated in `profiles` (if exists)
   - Tube focus is saved in `user_stitch_progress` with `is_current_tube` flag
   - Dashboard data is returned to show user progress summary

3. **On Next Visit**:
   - User data is retrieved from database tables
   - Tube position is determined from active stitches with `is_current_tube` flag
   - Learning continues from where the user left off

## Remaining Work

One remaining issue to address:

- **Dashboard Navigation**: The "Continue to Dashboard" button after session completion may need to be fixed to properly display user progress.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files have been updated:

- `API-DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated API endpoints documentation
- `DATABASE-SCHEMA.md` - Updated schema information
- `TUBE-POSITION-FIX.md` - Detailed explanation of tube position handling
- `DATA-PERSISTENCE-FIX-SUMMARY.md` (this file) - Overall summary of fixes

## Test Plan

1. Complete a session and click "Finish" to verify data is saved
2. Verify tube position is maintained between sessions
3. Verify stitch progression advances properly with perfect scores
4. Verify dashboard correctly displays user progress and stats
5. Verify anonymous users can complete sessions
6. Use `tests/tube-position-test.js` to verify tube position handling
