# Anonymous to Authenticated User Transition Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan outlines a systematic approach to verify improvements in the user authentication flow, specifically focusing on the transition from anonymous usage to authenticated accounts.

## Test Objectives
1. Verify that anonymous user data is properly transferred to authenticated accounts
2. Ensure progress is preserved during authentication
3. Confirm that the service worker correctly handles caching during transition
4. Validate proper initialization of new authenticated users

## Test Environment
- Browser: Latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Device: Desktop and mobile
- Network: Various conditions including slow connection and fast connection

## Test Cases

### 1. Anonymous User Data Storage
**Prerequisites:**
- Fresh browser session with no existing Zenjin data

**Steps:**
1. Load the application without logging in
2. Complete 2-3 learning stitches as an anonymous user
3. Verify anonymous data is stored in localStorage and IndexedDB
4. Check if user is presented with login/signup prompt after reaching certain progress

**Expected Results:**
- Anonymous session data is correctly stored
- Progress is tracked for anonymous users
- Login prompt appears at appropriate points

### 2. Anonymous to Authenticated Transition
**Prerequisites:**
- Existing anonymous session with learning progress

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for a new account or log into existing one
2. Verify transferAnonymousData function is called
3. Monitor network requests during transition
4. Check console for errors or warnings

**Expected Results:**
- transferAnonymousData function executes without errors
- API call to /api/transfer-anonymous-data succeeds
- No console errors during transition
- UI shows appropriate loading state during transition

### 3. Data Persistence After Authentication
**Prerequisites:**
- Completed anonymous to authenticated transition

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to dashboard or learning screen after authentication
2. Verify progress from anonymous session is visible
3. Continue learning journey from where anonymous session left off
4. Complete additional learning stitches
5. Sign out and sign back in

**Expected Results:**
- Anonymous progress is preserved after authentication
- Learning journey continues from the correct point
- New progress is saved correctly
- Progress remains after sign-out and sign-in cycle

### 4. Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Network Failure During Transition
**Steps:**
1. Start with anonymous session with progress
2. Enable throttling or offline mode
3. Attempt to authenticate
4. Restore network connection
5. Complete authentication

**Expected Results:**
- Graceful error handling during network failure
- Data is not lost if transition fails
- Transition can be completed when network is restored

#### 4.2 Multiple Anonymous Sessions
**Steps:**
1. Create anonymous session in browser A
2. Create different anonymous session in browser B
3. Authenticate with same account in both browsers

**Expected Results:**
- Data from both anonymous sessions is merged or handled according to business rules
- No data loss occurs
- No duplicate entries are created

#### 4.3 Re-authentication
**Steps:**
1. Sign in to existing account
2. Sign out
3. Create new anonymous session
4. Sign back in to the same account

**Expected Results:**
- Anonymous data is either discarded or merged according to business rules
- Authenticated account data takes precedence
- No regression of progress occurs

## Automation Strategy
1. Create Jest tests for transferAnonymousData function
2. Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress for full user flows
3. Add specific unit tests for edge cases

## Reporting
Document test results with:
- Screenshots of successful transitions
- Browser console logs
- Network request logs
- LocalStorage and IndexedDB state before and after
