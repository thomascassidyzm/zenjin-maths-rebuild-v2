# Authentication Implementation Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for the new authentication implementation. Use this guide to validate that the new auth system resolves the issues while maintaining all required functionality.

## Key Testing Areas

### 1. Authentication Flow

- [ ] Sign in with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with OTP (email verification)
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Anonymous access
- [ ] Session persistence across page reloads
- [ ] Session expiration handling

### 2. State Transitions and Loading States

- [ ] Verify that loading states are shown correctly during auth operations
- [ ] Verify that error states are displayed appropriately
- [ ] Confirm that state transitions are smooth and predictable
- [ ] Verify that components respond correctly to auth state changes

### 3. Performance Testing

- [ ] Verify that the recursive rendering issue is resolved
- [ ] Check performance during navigation between pages
- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage during auth operations
- [ ] Test on various devices to ensure performance is maintained

### 4. User Data Loading

- [ ] Verify that user data is loaded after successful authentication
- [ ] Confirm that offline access to cached data works as expected
- [ ] Test the refresh mechanism for user data
- [ ] Verify that all required data is available to components

### 5. Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with network interruptions
- [ ] Test with slow connections
- [ ] Test when localStorage is unavailable
- [ ] Test when API endpoints return errors

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Functionality

- [ ] New user sign-in works correctly 
- [ ] Returning user sign-in works correctly
- [ ] OTP verification process works end-to-end
- [ ] Sign-out properly clears all auth state and cached data
- [ ] Anonymous access provides limited functionality as expected

### Dashboard Functionality

- [ ] Dashboard loads and displays correct data for authenticated users
- [ ] Dashboard redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
- [ ] Dashboard refresh button works correctly
- [ ] Dashboard data is persisted in localStorage for offline access

### Home Page Functionality

- [ ] Home page shows appropriate options for authenticated users
- [ ] Home page shows appropriate options for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Navigation from home page to player and dashboard works correctly

### Player Functionality

- [ ] Player starts correctly for authenticated users
- [ ] Player shows appropriate experience for anonymous users
- [ ] Player progress is saved for authenticated users
- [ ] Session completion redirects properly based on auth state

## Migration Verification

- [ ] Existing users can sign in with the new implementation
- [ ] User progress data is correctly migrated
- [ ] Performance issues from the previous implementation are resolved
- [ ] No new bugs or regressions are introduced

## Performance Benchmarks

To verify that the recursive rendering issue is resolved, measure and document:

1. Initial page load time
2. CPU usage during navigation
3. Memory usage during session
4. Time to complete authentication
5. Time to load dashboard data

Compare these metrics to the previous implementation to ensure improvements.

## Testing Notes

* Test with both Chrome Developer Tools and React Developer Tools to monitor rendering cycles
* Use the Network panel to verify API calls and their sequencing
* Monitor console for any authentication or data loading errors
* Test across multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior
* Clear localStorage between tests to verify initial state handling
